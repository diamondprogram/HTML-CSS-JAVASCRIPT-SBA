# HTML-CSS-JAVASCRIPT-SBA
This is an assignment to create a set of webpages during my Per Scholas Course 

# Description:

The set of websites goes over briefly on three components used to create websites HTML,CSS, and JAVASCRIPT.
Each page goes in a brief overview on the topics along with some example and explanation
on how I was able to create the example along with some links to external sources for beginers
to learn more about the three componets used to create websites.
 

# Specifications:
