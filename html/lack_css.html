                            This is how a page would look like with out any CSS. The site will appear as a boring balnd
                            white box with text, images and such. The site looks uninspired, unprofessional and something 
                            that looks like a time capsual from the early days of the internet.
                        </p> 
                        <p>
                            lets fix that with a live demo to compare the diference between with and with out CSS. For this demo I will use something we have 
                            yet to talk about, JavaScript. I will get into Javasript more in it's own dedicated section, for now we'll create a simple Js function
                            to turn "off" and "on" CSS on this page.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our first function will add CSS to this page. This can be done in a couple of ways. 
                            One way, the long way would be to write a function to individually add CSS styling to
                            each element tag one at a time. This would get messy and not someything I would suggest on
                            doing for an entire page. Another way and what I will do for this example is to creat a 
                            link element tag referencing an external CSS sheet.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <img src="../imgs/load sheet function.PNG" style="width: 80%; height: 60%;">
                        <br>
                        <button onclick="loadsheet()">load a css sheet</button>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            our second function will "remove"/"delete" the link elements from the page returning the 
                            page back to how we saw it when we first loaded the page.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            our code would look something like this
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <img src="../imgs/delete sheet function.PNG"style="width: 80%; height: 60%;">
                        <br>
                        <button onclick="deletesheets()">Remove Css</button>
                        <p>
                            As you can see simply adging some color properties and formating the text goes 
                            along way in creating effective web page desgins.
                        </p>
