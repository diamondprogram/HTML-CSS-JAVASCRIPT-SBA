                        To Achieve the affect of determining if a word contains a number such as (ex:1,2,3,4,5, et...) or speical characters
                        such as "^&*&^%#", we use regex or "regualr expressions". By using Regex we can check for a patern of characters in a given string/word.
                    </p>
                    <img id = "ispalimg" src="../imgs/regex.PNG" style ="width: 60%; height: 40%;">
                    <p id = "ispalpara2">
                        As shown in the above code we have two different regualr expressions variables with different expression values. The way regex works
                        is that it match character combinations in strings to the charcters defined in the regex object. Our Regex object "format" was set with 
                        all special characters except for ' character. The second regex object is set to \d/ which means all digit/number characters. Using an If
                        statement we can check if the string has either a number, special charcter that isnt a ' or both. the || symbol between 
                        "if(hasNumber.test(checker2[0]) || !letters.test(checker2[0]))" is an "or" statement which means if one of these conditons is true,
                        the word has a number, a special character or both, the word is in valid.
                    </p>
                    <p id = "ispalpara3" >
                        If the word dosen't contain sepcial characters or any numbers the else statment code runs. Is the code we define a var called "str"
                        and set it equal to the lowercase version of the value of the "word" variable. Then we split into indiviual charcter in an array <em>basically a list of the characters that made up the word</em>
                        <em>(Ex: "cat" => ["c","a","t"]) </em> the we reverse the list <em>(Ex: "cat" => ["c","a","t"] => ["t","a","c"]) </em>, finally wwe rejoin the word and compare it to the 
                        orignal lowercase string.
                     </p>

                        This uses a simple if statement as to the happy-birthday function to detect if the user didn't enter a word into the text field.
