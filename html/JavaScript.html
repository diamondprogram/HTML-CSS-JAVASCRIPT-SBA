                        So we have gone over how Html works and the basic working of web sites. We gone over What is CSS and how to use it to create
                        stunning looking sites, now It's time to go over JavaScript and the role it plays in web designs. 
                    </p>
                    <h2>
                        what is JavaScript?
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        You may have heard of the programing Language Java, but don't be confused between Java and JavaScript. They are not the same language and have many
                        differences. JavaScript is a scripting language used to add extra functionality to a webpage.Some of the things Java Script can do is update and change both HTML and CSS.
                        JavaScript can also calculate, manipulate and validate data. It is really up to th web developer how to use Javascript in their pages.
                        <br>
                        You can use JavaScript to create an entire web base application or moblie app. JavaScript can also be used on the backend to get data from
                        a web server, but for these next ables we'll be using JavaScript to add some extra interactivity to our webpages.
                        Here's a video on what's java script and what it can be used for.
                        <br>
                        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/upDLs1sn7g4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                     
                    </p>

                    <h2>How does it work?</h2>

                    <p>
                      Remeber earlier when We viewed the demo of a page that Lack CSS vs having CSS, we had used Javascript to achieve that affect. Now 
                      I will go into detail how that was achieved. 
                      <br>
                      <img src="../imgs/load sheet function.PNG" style="width: 80%; height: 60%;">
                      <br>
                      In JavaScript can can declare Variables to hold refernces to data/values. So for example instead of writing the number value "304052944" throught out my code
                      we can just write var x = "304052944", now we can just put x where "304052944" should be. In the example code above I had
                      set the variable link and bootstraplink to a html link element generated in the Js code. 'bootstraplink = document.createElement("link");' tells javascript 
                      that when a I say bootstraplink in the code, it represent the link element generated by the code document.createElement("link"). The same applies to the link variable as well.
                      The line bootstraplink.setAttribute("rel","stylesheet") and the following setattributes commands add extra information to the link elments we created.
                      The html evqualant of the javascript link variable will be "&#60;link rel = 'stylesheet' type='text/css' href = 'page1.css'&#62;"
                      <br>
                      Then we create a variable call head where by using the getElementByTagName('head') the variable now refernces the headtag in the html file.
                      using the command .appendchild() we tell the javascript to add the two link object elments under the headtag in the html file , which ther by adds
                      a CSS sheet to our webpage.
                      <br>
                      Of course Java script can be used for much more, but one thing I should go over before moving on. Javascript can be implemented inside the html file
                      like in my example above which is done inside the html doc, another way to write a independant JavaScript file and in the html file link it to the JS script file.
                      It is what you will need to add to your html file if you're using an external JS file vs an internal JavaScript.
                      </p>
                      <p style="color:rgb(1, 121, 168); background-color:black;" >
                        &#60; script src="myjsfile"&#62;&#60;/script&#62; //this is external JS
                        <br>
           
                        <br>
                        &#60;script&#62; <br>
                            //..enter your code here for intenal js code
                        <br>
                        &#60;/script&#62;
                      </p>
                      <p>
                          For best pratices I suggest using external over internal JS if you'll be handing data give by the user. JavaScript can be used to add some extra interactive
                          features into your site. We can create functions to handle inforation provided by the user for example.
                      </p>
                      <p>this in this demo enter a serveral number seperate by spaces at tha javascript will reutn the sume of them <em>*this dose not take negative number only positive</em>.
                        We can use the form tag to directlt display the output as we type in the numbers by using the tag attribute "oninput=ourfunction()".
                      </p>
                      <form oninput="sum()">
                        <input type="text" id="sums" pattern="/\d/">
                      </form>
                      
                        <div id = "boxout"></div>

                        <p>
                            This next set of demos we'll use html form tags so we can send data from one html page into another page.
                            Let's keep it simple and simply request the user to enter a name and age. we'll also add a pattern:regex attribute in
                            the name text bar preventing special charcetrs being entered html side
                        </p>
                        <form action="../html/Happyb-day.html" method="get">
                            <input type = "text" id = "name" placeholder="Johnny Test" name = "name"  pattern="^[A-Za-z]+$">
                            <input type="number" id = 'age' placeholder="10" name="age">
                            <input type="submit">
                        </form>
                        <p>
                            This next example we will be using JavaScript for user input Regex valdidation. we'll also used the form tag to run this in 
                            another page as well. This is return a string enter by the user that contains only chacters A thorugh Z and if the word is a paladrone. 
                            If their is any numbers or speical charcetrs like %^#* it will display a message saying "Numeric and speical charcet detected".
                        </p>
                        <form action="../html/ispal_no_num_schars.html" method="GET">
                            <input type = "text" id = "paladrone" placeholder="bob" name = "name">
                            <input type="submit">
                        </form>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>
                        With a combination of JavaScript, CSS and Html you can create dynamic, eyecatching sites. Html, creates the basic
                        flow of the page as we went over in html and css sections. CSS adds a "layer of paint", giving the once bland white box
                        with some text and images some style and makes your site more appealing to your guest/users. Finally Javascript adds extra interactivity/processing information
                        to your sites.
